# Hi, I'm Myles! ðŸ‘‹


## About Me 
Welcome to my corner of the Universe! I'm a data analyst and scientist with over 8 years of experience working in one of the most data intensive fields: astrophysics, where I analyzed galaxy evolution using data across the ultraviolet, optical, infrared, and radio wavelengths. My background includes developing advanced data processing, modeling, and visualization workflows to extract meaningful insights from complex, high-dimensional datasets. Along the way, Iâ€™ve gained a deep appreciation for our placein the universe and a drive to contribute to progress here on Earth by applying my technical skills and leadership experience to real-world challenges. Iâ€™m passionate about continuous learning, connecting with people from diverse backgrounds, and exploring better ways to manage time, workflows, and technology to make impactful work more efficient and accessible.

### â˜• When Iâ€™m not coding or analyzing data:
- Iâ€™m experimenting with loose-leaf teas and blending my own flavors  
- Getting lost in the worlds of video games  
- Enjoying peaceful moments watching water and nature  

Letâ€™s connect! Feel free to reach out through my social links or email. Looking forward to chatting!
